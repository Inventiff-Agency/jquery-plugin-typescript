= jQuery Plugin TypeScript Example

This example project demonstrates how to write a jQuery plugin using TypeScript.

It incorporates the following concepts to facilitate development and provide modern deployment:

. Source code of the jQuery plugin can be written in TypeScript with all the benefits like type checking, code completion etc.
. Source code of the jQuery plugin can be structured into various modules to allow separation of concerns and reuse of certain classes or functions.
. Source code of the jQuery plugin is automatically tested using https://karma-runner.github.io/[Karma] and https://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine].
. TypeScript modules are compiled into modern ES2015 modules which can be loaded in modern browsers.
. ES2015 modules are bundled into a single JavaScript file using http://rollupjs.org/[rollup.js]. The bundle is converted to ES5 language level for better browser compatibility.
. JavaScript bundle is minified using http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/[UglifyJS] to further reduce its size.

== Getting Started
